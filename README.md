# Monte Carlo VaR Estimator

This Python script estimates Value at Risk (VaR) using Monte Carlo simulations. It reads historical return data from a CSV file, simulates future returns, and calculates the VaR based on these simulations.

Features
Data Import: Reads historical returns from a CSV file.
Simulation: Utilizes Monte Carlo methods to forecast potential future returns.
VaR Calculation: Computes Value at Risk (VaR) for a given confidence level.
Visualization: Generates a histogram of simulated returns and highlights the VaR.
